# SensorResponse-inSilico
In-silico study to simulate bias due to delayed sensor response.

In environmental sensing, especially in total parameter monitoring, we need to monitor not one but at least two analytes simultaneously and ideally at the same location. However, due to differences in sensor characteristics, e.g., acquisition rate, sensor response, etc., it can be cumbersome to do this for multiple sensors.
Although this bottleneck is well known, it is common to adapt the measurement procedure to the faster sensor, accepting a (small) inaccuracy for the total parameter. However, no one has yet investigated the extend of the inaccuracy. Is the inaccuracy acceptable or does the error propagation that is initially accepted falsify the overall result and make it unusable. 

This software allows the user (mac or windows) to examine a given dual sensor system, study the influence of different sensor responses and thereby optimize the measurement procedure.
